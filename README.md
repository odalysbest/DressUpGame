This project creates a game in which the user helps an alien choose an outfit
that is appropriate for a certain situation. This program was created as our final project for the course Software Design FA19 at Olin College.

**Getting Started:**

Our program uses the pygame library to run interactively. To install pygame
run `pip install pygame` in the terminal. It is recommended to run pygame
Python 3 or more recent.

**Usage:**

To start the game, run 'Pygamescript2.py'. This should open an interactive
display where you will be prompted to dress the alien for an event. Click on the
buttons for a category of clothing and then select an article of clothing.
Upon clicking, the item should appear on the alien, clicking again will remove
the item from the alien. Once you have put together an outfit, clicking the
'complete' button will generate your score based on how appropriately the alien
is dressed for the situation.
